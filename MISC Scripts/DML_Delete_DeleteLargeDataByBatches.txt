Description:
	a demonstration on how to delete a large amount of data by 
	using batch deleting in order to minimize contention and maximize 
	concurrency

Notes:
	- change 'YourTable' to the table to delete from

	- set @batch_size to the desire amount of rows to delete per 
	batch

	- modify the DELETE FROM statement for your specific application 
	to include a WHERE clause if it is necessary
